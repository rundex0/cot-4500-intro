After downloading the zip file, first make sure all the necessary libraries are installed from the requirements.txt. You can do this by navigating to this file in the terminal using the 'cd' command to change directories and using 'ls' to view the files within. Once there, downlaod the required libraries with 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.

Once those are installed, you can run the program with 'python3 intro-to-python.py' (or just 'python' for earlier versions of python).
